moments, a previously unseen panel opens, and a diagnostic robot comes wheeling
out. It is very rusty and sways unsteadily, bumping into several pieces of
infirmary equipment as it crosses the room. As the robot straps you to the bed,
you notice some smoke curling from its cracks. Beeping happily, the robot
injects you with all 347 serums and medicines it carries. The last thing you
notice before you pass out is the robot preparing to saw your legs off."

Ramos Two, and you and your shipmates are having a pretty rowdy time. Through
the windows of the pub you can see a mighty, ancient castle, shining in the
light of the three Ramosian moons. The Fire Nectar spreads through your blood
and you begin to feel drowsy..."

more strangely, you are only eight years old again. You are playing with your
pet sponge-cat, Swanzo, on the edge of the pond in your backyard. Mom is
hanging orange towels on the clothesline. Suddenly the school bully jumps out
from behind a bush, grabs you, and pushes your head under the water. You try to
scream, but cannot. You feel your life draining away..."

overlooking a waterfall. A rainbow spans the falls. Blather stands above you,
bellowing that the ground is filthy -- scrub harder! You throw your brush at
Blather, but it passes thru him as though he were a ghost, and sails over the
cliff. Blather leaps after the valuable piece of Patrol property, and both
plummet into the void..."

Currents buffet you against the sharp rocks of an underwater cliff. A dim light
filters down from above."
16702: S101 "A mighty undertow drags you across some underwater obstructions."
1672a: S102 "You have reached a cleft in the cliff wall where the island rises
from the water. The edge of the cleft displays recently exposed rock where it
collapsed under the weight of the escape pod. About two meters below, turbulent
waters swirl against sharp rocks. A small structure clings to the face of the
cliff about eight meters above you. Even an out-of-shape Ensign Seventh Class
could probably climb up to it."
16816: S103 "This was once the west wing of the castle, but the walls are now
mostly rubble, allowing a view of the cliff and ocean below. Rubble blocks all
exits save one, eastward to the courtyard."
16884: S104 "Certain death."
1688e: S105 "This is a featureless hall leading north and south. Although the
hallway is old and dusty, the construction is of a much more modern style than
the castle to the south. A similar hall branches off to the northeast."
168fe: S106 "This is a tiny room with a large ~1~ painted on the wall. A panel
contains a slot about ten centimeters wide, a beige button labelled ~2~ and a
tan button labelled ~3~."
16954: S107 "This is a wide, east-west hallway. Portals lead north and south,
and another corridor branches southwest."
16990: S108 "This is a very long room lined with multi-tiered bunks. Flimsy
partitions between the tiers may have provided a modicum of privacy. This
spartan living quarters could have once housed many hundreds, but it seems
quite deserted now. There are openings at the north and south ends of the
room."
16a32: S109 "This must be the sanitary facility for the adjacent dormitory. The

16be2: S115 "There is a large aluminum ladder here."
16bf4: S116 "This is a wide, east-west hallway with openings to the north and
south. To the east, the corridor stretches off into the distance. That section
of the hallway is lined with a motorized walkway (no longer running) that was
probably intended to transport people or cargo down that tremendously long
hall."
16c94: S117 "This is the food production and dispensary area for the dining
hall to the north. Of particular interest is a machine near the door. You
should probably examine it more closely."
16cfa: S118 "Although the room is quite barren, an octagonally-shaped canteen
is sitting on one of the benches."
16d36: S119 "A north-south corridor intersects the main corridor here. To the
west, the main corridor extends as far as you can see; a non-working walkway
from that direction ends here. To the east, the corridor widens into a well-lit
area."
16dae: S120 "This section of hallway seems to have suffered some minor
structural damage. The walls are cracked, and a jagged crevice crosses the
floor. An opening leads east and the corridor heads north and south."
16e12: S121 "Lying at the bottom of a narrow crevice is a shiny object."
16e38: S122 "You get a brief (but much closer) view of the sharp and nasty
rocks at the bottom of the rift."
16e70: S123 "Here is another sanitary facility. Like the others, it is dusty
and non-functional."
16ea6: S124 "This is a small room whose far wall is covered with many small
cubbyholes, all empty. The left wall is covered with an enormous map, labelled
~Kalamontee Kompleks~, showing two installations connected by a long hallway.
Near the upper part of this map is a red arrow saying ~Yuu ar heer~. The right
wall is covered with a similar map, labelled ~Lawanda Kompleks~, showing two
installations, one apparently buried deep underground."

the main doorway which lies to the east. Another exit leads west."

window, scratched but unbroken, offering a view of this installation and the
ocean beyond. In front of the window is a wide wooden desk. The only exit is
east."

hall."

southeast."

1714e: S134 "This is a huge, dim room with exits in the northeast and southeast
corners. The room is criss-crossed with catwalks and is filled with heavy
equipment presumably intended to heat and ventilate this complex. Hardly any of
the equipment is still operating."
171dc: S135 "This room contains many dials and gauges for controlling a massive
planetary power reactor which, according to a diagram on the wall, must be
buried far below this very complex. The exit is to the west. To the east is a
metal door, and next to it, a button. A dark stairway winds downward."
17288: S136 "This is an elevator with a door to the west, currently open. A
control panel contains an Up button, a Down button, and a small slot."

and east."

contains a slot about ten centimeters wide, a brown button labelled ~1~ and a
tan button labelled ~3~."
176ec: S175 "This is a small, circular room. A sliding door leads north, and a
spiral staircase heads upwards. Other exits lie to the northeast and
southwest."
17742: S176 "You are at the center of a wide, flat area atop the tower. A fence
prevents you from approaching the perimeter, so your view is limited to
cloud-filled sky. A large vehicle, severely weathered and topped with rotor
blades, lies nearby. A spiral staircase leads down into the tower."
177e0: S177 "A fence keeps you away from the edge, where you would probably be
swept over the brink by the high winds."
1781a: S178 "This is a large vehicle with a lot of cargo space. A complex
control panel is closed and locked. Everything is covered with a thick layer of
rust. Through the windows of the vehicle you can see a wide Helipad, and beyond
that, endless ocean far below. Several doors lead out to the Helipad."

the island, and the rest of the complex sprawls out directly below. In the
distance, about 20 kilometers to the east, you can spot another island similar
to this one. The only exit is a doorway leading northeast."

storage cabinets, all locked. To the south, a narrow stairway leads upward. On
the north wall of the room is a very small doorway."

17dba: S197 "Lying face down at the bottom of the stairs is a motionless robot.
It appears to be damaged beyond repair."

~Planateree Deefens~. The corridor continues east and west."

opening to the west."

dorms, this one is smaller and has no bathing fixtures."
1929a: S251 "You are at the center of a long east-west hallway. A doorway,
labelled ~PrajKon Awfis~, opens to the south."
192d8: S252 "The hallway ends here but continues back toward the west. Doorways
lead north, south and east."
19308: S253 "This is the main computer room for the Project. The only sign of

19528: S255 "This is a small room barely large enough for one person. Mounted
on the wall is a small slot, and next to it a keyboard with numeric keys. The
exit is to the north."
1957c: S256 "This is the heart of the Project's vast laboratory complex. There
are exits to the west and southwest, and heavy metal doors to the northeast and
southeast. A small doorway leads south."
195dc: S257 "This is a tiny room for the storage of laboratory supplies. The
sole exit is to the north."
1960e: S258 "Hanging on a rack is a pale blue lab uniform. Sewn onto its pocket
is a non-descript logo."
1964a: S259 "This is the first half of a sterilization chamber to prevent
contamination of the delicate biological experiments in the Bio Lab which lies
beyond. The door to the west leads to the main lab, and the bio lock continues
eastward."
196c4: S260 "The is the second half of the sterilization chamber leading from
the main lab to the Bio Lab. The door to the east, leading to the Bio Lab, has
a window. The bio lock continues to the west."
19722: S261 "This is the western half of a decontamination chamber to prevent
dangerous radioactive materials from leaving the Radiation Lab which lies to
the east. The door leads west to the main lab."
1978a: S262 "This is the eastern half of the decontamination chamber. The door
to the east leads to the Radiation Lab, and the chamber continues westward. A
sign on the wall reads ~WORNEENG! Raadeeaashun suuts must bee worn beeyond xis

19810: S263 "Opening the door reveals a Bio-Lab full of horrible mutations. You
stare at them, frozen with horror. Growling with hunger and delight, the
mutations march into the bio-lock and devour you."
19880: S264 "A very bored-sounding recorded voice explains that, in order to
prevent contamination, both lock doors cannot be open simultaneously."
198d0: S265 "The door opens."
198d6: S266 "The door closes."
198de: S267 "The biological nightmares reach you. Gripping coils wrap around
your limbs as powerful teeth begin tearing at your flesh. Something bites your
leg, and you feel a powerful poison begin to work its numbing effects..."
1995e: S268 " Unfortunately, you don't seem to be that hardy."
19978: S269 "The mutants attack you and rip you to shreds within seconds."
1999a: S270 "Dozens of hungry eyes fix on you as the mutations surround you and
begin feasting."
199cc: S271 "You stupidly run right into the jaws of the pursuing mutants."
199f0: S272 "The growling humanoid is charging straight at you, waving his
axe-like implement!"
19a22: S273 "A pair of slavering fangs removes part of your clothing!"
19a46: S274 "Needle-sharp mandibles nip at your arms!"
19a60: S275 "The mobile plant whips its poisonous tentacles against your
ankles!"
19a86: S276 "This room is filled with unfathomable equipment and large
canisters bearing radioactive warnings. Many of the canisters are split open.
You can see the Bio Lab through a large crack in the south wall.
Sinister-looking forms move about within the Bio Lab. Although the lights here
are off, the room is suffused with a pale blue glow."
19b3c: S277 "It seems you have picked up a bad case of radiation poisoning."
19b5e: S278 "Sitting on a long table is a small brown spool."
19b7c: S279 "The spool is labelled ~Instrukshunz foor Reepaareeng Reepaar

19baa: S280 "There is a powerful portable lamp here, currently off."

19c9c: S283 "You hear the faint sound of a relay clicking."
19cb8: S284 "This is another small booth. Unlike the Miniaturization Booth,
this room has no slot or keyboard, so presumably it is intended only as a
receiving station. The exit is on the northern side."
19d1e: S285 "You are standing on a square plate of heavy metal. Above your
head, parallel to the plate beneath you, is an identical metal plate. To the
east is a wide, metallic strip."
19d84: S286 "You feel the familiar wrenching of your innards, and find yourself
in a vast room whose distant walls are rushing straight toward you...^"
19dd6: S287 "You are standing on a silicon filament, which looks to you like a
wide metal highway. South of here, the filament makes a right angle and heads
straight down, like a cliff overlooking a black void. The filament can be
followed north, however. Station 384 lies westward."
19e76: S288 "The plunge would probably be fatal."
19e88: S289 "You are standing on a section of the strip with a bottomless void
stretching out on both sides. The strip continues to the north and south."
19ed0: S290 "Not a chance -- unless, of course, you don't mind walking into the
gullet of a hungry microbe."
19f0a: S291 "Do you have a penchant for bottomless voids?"
19f24: S292 "There is a huge featureless wall there, remember?"
19f3a: S293 "A small device, labelled ~Akmee Portabul Laazur~, is resting on
one of the lower shelves."
19f6e: S294 "There is a worn-out laser battery here."
19f86: S295 "The odds and ends on the shelves include a small round object,
which closer inspection reveals to be a fresh laser battery."

1a000: S302 "slightly warm"
1a004: S303 "The beam just misses the speck!"
1a018: S304 "A near miss!"
1a022: S305 "A good shot, but just a little wide of the target."
1a040: S306 "With a furious storm of electrical mayhem, Sector 384 comes to
life. A few micro-volts course through the silicon strip on which you stand.
Unfortunately, at your current size, this is enough to barbecue you."
1a0be: S307 "A hungry microbe blocks your way, its cilia waving and its
pseudo-pods towering over you."
1a0f8: S308 " The microbe, whipped into a rabid frenzy by the waves of heat
from the pulsing laser, literally lunges at it. You jump back and, losing your
balance, fall over the edge of the strip. The microbe, writhing madly, hurls
itself after its prey. You and the microbe both plunge into the void below."
1a1a4: S309 "The microbe wraps several pseudo-pods around you and shoves you
into its mucous-covered gullet. Digestive juices begin their work. The
experience is not pleasant."
1a206: S310 "A pseudo-pod extends toward you. You jump back just in time to
avoid being engulfed."
1a23e: S311 "A slimy pseudo-pod brushes against your shoulder. You twist away
in the nick of time."
1a26e: S312 "A pseudo-pod shoots out toward your head! Ducking quickly, you
save your life."
1a2a0: S313 "Two protoplasm-filled blobs sneak toward you from the left. You
jump to the side and almost fall off the strip into the void below!"
1a2e8: S314 "The microbe slithers closer. The cilia around its gullet glisten
with mucous, giving the impression that the microbe is salivating."
1a332: S315 "The microbe flows toward you. It towers above you, its cilia
waving madly in your face."
1a368: S316 "The monster wriggles nearer. It is now so close that you can make
out details in the protoplasm beneath its translucent skin."
1a3b4: S317 "The microbe's outer membrane sizzles a bit, and some protoplasm
oozes out. The microbe recoils momentarily, but quickly recovers."
1a404: S318 "The beam slices through the microbe's skin! A tremendous shudder
passes through the microbe, but the wound quickly seals itself."
1a44e: S319 "The monster rears back for a moment, but almost as soon as the
beam goes off, it advances again."
1a48a: S320 "A ferocious feral creature, with a hairy shelled body and a
whip-like tail snaps its enormous mandibles at you."
1a4d0: S321 "Rushing toward you is an ugly, deformed humanoid, bellowing in a
gutteral tongue. It brandishes a piece of lab equipment shaped somewhat like a
battle axe."
1a532: S322 "Lurking nearby is a vicious-looking creature with slavering fangs.
Squinting in the light, it eyes you hungrily."
1a57a: S323 "A giant plant, teeming with poisonous tentacles, is shuffling
toward you on three leg-like stalks."
